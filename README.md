#### TODO:

- Test if user provided callables fail - what happen then? How to communicate exception from the monitor thread to the main process? Close the pool?
- Test if a worker just fails (raise manually)
- Test with proper model (YOLO or something)
- More thorough testing from multiple threaded callers + API test
- Scheduling and getting results is blocking - bad
